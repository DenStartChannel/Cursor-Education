						A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction
						since the 1880s, and of aerospace engineering and scientific
						proposals since the late 1940s. Plans include landing on Mars for
						exploration at a minimum, with some considering exploring its moons
						Phobos and Deimos. Longterm proposals have included sending settlers
						and starting terraforming of the planet.

					<p class="content__text">
						The exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs
						for decades. Conceptual work for missions that would involve human
						explorers has been ongoing since
						<strong> the 1950s </strong>
						, with planned missions typically being stated as taking place
						anywhere between 10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted.The
						list of <strong>crewed</strong> Mars mission plans shows the various
						mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations
						and space agencies in this field of space exploration. Plans have
						varied from scientific expeditions, in which a small group (between
						two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a period of a few
						weeks or year, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research
						stations, colonization or other continuous humanization).[citation
						needed] Virtual visits to Mars, using haptic technologies, have also
						been proposed.[ In the 2010s, numerous US, European, and Asian
						agencies were developing proposals for human missions to
						Mars.[citation needed] In fiction, Mars is a frequent target of
						exploration and settlement in books, graphic novels, and films.
